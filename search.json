    "text": "Niveau : Licence 3\nSemestre : 2\nVolume horaire : 18 heures de cours (CM) et 18 heures de pratique (TD)\nIntervenant : Stéphane Gonzalez\nContact : stephane.gonzalez@univ-st-etienne.fr\nObjectifs du cours : Ce cours est conçu pour familiariser les étudiants avec les principales théories de la croissance économique. Les modèles de Harrod-Domar, Solow, Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans, Romer, Barro et Goodwin seront abordés. Chaque modèle sera étudié mathématiquement et appliqué à différentes politiques économiques à travers une simulation en Python. L’objectif est d’amener l’étudiant à une autonomie suffisante pour conseiller quantitativement un décideur sur les questions de croissance économique.\nPlan de cours :\n\nIntroduction aux théories de la croissance\nÉtude mathématique et simulation des modèles de croissance\nApplication des modèles à différentes politiques économiques\nUtilisation de Python pour la simulation de modèles économiques\n\nCompétences développées : À la fin de ce cours, les étudiants seront capables de comprendre et de construire des modèles dynamiques en économie, de les étudier mathématiquement et de les appliquer à différentes politiques économiques. Ils auront également acquis des compétences transversales telles que la capacité de lire un diagramme de phase, d’étudier qualitativement une équation différentielle ordinaire, et de réaliser des simulations en Python.\nModalités d’évaluation : L’évaluation se fera sur la base d’une épreuve écrite.\nPrérequis : Cours introductif à l’analyse mathématique. Connaissance de base de la programmation en Python est un plus.\nBibliographie / références :\n\n“Introduction to Modern Economic Growth” - Daron Acemoglu\n“Théories économiques de la croissance” - Robert J.
